# Restaurant-Management-Project
The objective of this project is to design an object-oriented system in C++ while using classes, standard data structures and unique
C++ properties such as the “Rule of 5”.

In this project we simulate a restaurant management system. The program will open the restaurant, assign customers to tables, make orders,
provide bills to the tables, and other requests as described in the assignment specifications linked below.
